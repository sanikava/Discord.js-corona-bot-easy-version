# Discord.js Corona Bot Easy Version

A simple Discord bot that fetches COVID-19 data using a Corona API. Built with Discord.js.

## Features

- Retrieves the latest COVID-19 statistics
- Easy setup with configuration for token and command prefix
- Lightweight and straightforward functionality

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.

2. Create a `config.json` file in the root directory with the following structure:
```json
{
"token": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
"prefix": "!"
}
```
- Replace `"YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"` with your actual Discord bot token.
- Set `"prefix"` to your preferred command prefix.

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install discord.js```

4. Run the bot:
```bash
node index.js
```
## Note

This project is being archived as COVID-19 is no longer a pressing concern, and therefore, there is no ongoing need for this bot.

## Disclaimer

Keep your bot token secure. Never share it or commit it to public repositories.
